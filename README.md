[Syllabus](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/syllabus/)

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.

## Expectations

You are expected to

- submit ten problem sets
- submit nine labs
- submit a final project

## Certificates
CS50x is free to take, and you are welcome to submit the course’s ten problem sets and final project for automated feedback. To be eligible for a verified certificate from edX, however, you must receive a satisfactory score (at least 70%) on each problem you submit as part of one of the course’s ten problem sets as well as on the course’s final project.

Problems are evaluated along axes of correctness (as determined by a program called check50) and style (as determined by a program called style50), with scores ordinarily computed as 3 × correctness + 1 × style.
