## Step 1 of 3

Create a short video (that’s no more than 3 minutes in length) in which you present your project to the world, as with slides, screenshots, voiceover, and/or live action. Your video should somehow include your project’s title, your name, your city and country, and any other details that you’d like to convey to viewers. See [howtogeek.com](https://www.howtogeek.com/205742/how-to-record-your-windows-mac-linux-android-or-ios-screen/) for tips on how to make a “screencast,” though you’re welcome to use an actual camera. Upload your video to YouTube (or, if blocked in your country, a similar site) and take note of its URL; it’s fine to flag it as “unlisted,” but don’t flag it as “private.”

## Step 2 of 3

Create a README.md text file (named exactly that!) in your project folder that explains your project. This file should include your Project Title, the URL of your video (created in step 1 above) and a description of your project. You may use the below as a template.
```
# YOUR PROJECT TITLE
#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>
#### Description:
TODO
```
If unfamiliar with Markdown syntax, you might find GitHub’s [Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) helpful. If you are using the CS50 Codespace and are prompted to “Open in CS50 Lab”, you can simply press Cancel to open your file in the Editor. You can also preview your .md file by clicking the ‘preview’ icon as explained here: [Markdown Preview in vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview). Standard software project READMEs can often run into the thousands or tens of thousands of words in length; yours need not be that long, but should at least be several hundred words that describe things in detail!

Execute the submit50 command below from within your project directory (or from whichever directory contains README.md file and your project’s code, which must also be submitted), logging in with your GitHub username and password when prompted. For security, you’ll see asterisks instead of the actual characters in your password.

```

```

## Step 3 of 3 
Be sure to visit your gradebook at cs50.me/cs50x a few minutes after you submit. It’s only by loading your Gradebook that the system can check to see whether you have completed the course, and that is also what triggers the (instant) generation of your free CS50 Certificate and the (within 30 days) generation of the Verified Certificate from edX, if you’ve completed all of the other assignments. Be sure to claim your free certificate (by following the link at the top of your gradebook) before 1 January 2024.
